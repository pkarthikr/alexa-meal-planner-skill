ToDo : 

1. Determine if the user has set the plan for the week, and if not tell them about setting a meal plan. 
2. Handle Utterances like what am I cooking today for {current Meal}
2. Handle Multi Value Slots so we can ask what am I cooking with Capsicum and Onions? 

Alexa, ask meal planner what am I cooking today?
Alexa, ask meal planner what am I cooking today for dinner? 
Alexa, ask meal planner, what is going to be my next meal? 
Alexa, ask meal planner, what am I cooking now? 

Alexa, ask meal planner what can I cook with capsicum and onions (< Multi Value Slots, so will work for only English locales (Except IN) for this moment>)
